# Map Routing Project
   #3 Files:
    -NodeVertex.java
    -ProjectMain.java
    -Queue.java
    #4 .txts to Test
      -sale.txt (main one)
      -saleTenThousand.txt (.txt with TenThousand)
      -smallsale.txt
      -testing.txt
      
# WHAT TO RUN
  1) Run ProjectMain.java and on LINE 16 use sale.txt
        -sale.txt is full file which takes approximately 2 MINUTES to run because of the file size
  2) Run ProjectMain.java and on LINE 16 use saleTenThousand.txt
        -saleTenThousand.txt takes few SECONDS to run
  I also have smallsale.txt which I thought to include because it shows I started programming this algorithm on and
  testing it with.
  
# IMPORTANT NOTES
 My GUI is inside of my ProjectMain.java. My GUI is a map with all of the points of the file that it reads in scaled directly to fit
 the screen. The user interacts with the console. The console asks for a start and end Node. In the console the program will print the 
 path and it will also print the path in the GUI below the map. I have a few toString methods in my Queue and my NodeVertex so if you 
 test the program it will be easy to follow the Queue, prev variables, etc....
# WHEN TESTING
  When testing this program and picking nodes please note that it might be diffuclt to see the path sometimes because it is so small
  TWO POINTS for testing are 5437 as a start and 5831 as an end
  -this path is a small red path in california and will print [5437, 5454, 5462, 5469, 5490, 5513, 5611, 5650, 5653, 5673, 5708, 5711, 5736, 5742, 5755, 5769, 5782, 5786, 5831]
  -it will take about 2 minutes to run
